After Split the video frames and audio, how to play separately?

Possible solutions:
    1. Write the frame buffer into an new avi file, and then use System.Windows.Controls.mediaElement to load and 
play frames. Then load the audio invisibly.

            Possible problems:
            a. Synchronization?
            b. Waste of resource?

        Use API to create virtual file.


    3. Change the app framework to SilverSlight. 
            Problems: Painful.
